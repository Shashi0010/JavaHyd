Files :
________

A file is a collection of data, which allows you to store output permanently. 

To deal with files, we need java.io package 

File class :
____________

This class allows you to deal with files. 

File obj=new File(filename); 

FileReader : Used to read the data from the file. 

read() : Used to read data char/char and returns the ascii value, we have to typecast to char type.
it returns -1 once it reaches the end of file.  It reads the data w.r.t. Unicode format. 

FileWriter : Allows you to write the data into the file. 

write() : used to write data char/char. 

The drawback with FileReader is it reads only the text data. For reading all kinds of data, we need

FileInputStream : used to read data w.r.t. Stream of bytes. 

FileOutputStream : used to write data w.r.t. Stream of bytes. 

DataOutputStream : Used to write primitive types into the file. 


writeInt()
writeUTF()
writeDouble()
writeBoolean() 


BufferedReader : Allows you to read the data from the keyboard. 

BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

readLine() : used to read one line of input from the keyboard. 

ObjectOutuptStream  : Used to write an object into the file.

		writeObject() : Used to write an object into the file. 

ObjectInputStream  : Used to read an object from the file.

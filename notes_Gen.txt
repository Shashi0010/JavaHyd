What is the difference betweenn Comparable and Comparator 

Comparable implements compareTo(), where comparator implements compare()

By default, we have to speecify the sort field, please use Comparable

Comparable can be applied on same class, but comparator takes another class to implement.

You can apply more than one comparator, but only one comparble will be allowed. 

Generics : 
___________

Generics provides an opportunity to define data types at runtime, 

	if you want to make any method as write once and apply for all types, then we need the 
		help of generics. 


	You can define generics by using <T>, as in place of T we can pass any type. 

Advantages of Generics : 
_________________________

	-> Write Once and apply for all types.

	-> No Typecasting Required

	-> Reduces the size of the program. 

	-> Implements Security.

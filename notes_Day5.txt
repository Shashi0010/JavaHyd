static variables : 

These are called class varaiables, which used to initilize the static variables of the class. 

These variables can be accessable by using classname. 

static methods : These are the methods, that which are to be called by using class_name.
No object required to call these methods. 

StringBuilder : Which contains predefined methods, which allows you to make changes on 
given string. 

EmployValidate will perform the following validations.

	1) empno not negative

Inheritance : The concept of deriving a new class from already existing class known as inheritane,
the class which is derived known as derived class, the class from which its derived known as base class. 

Through inheritance, we can reduce the size of the program. 

class A {
...
...
}

class B extends A{
...
...
}


Once you create an object to class B, then you can access all public/protected and friendly 
members of class A. 

super keyword : If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, then we need the help of
super keyword, it has 2 forms as 

	(i) super as a keyword

       (ii) super as a constructor 


abstract class : 
_________________


A class that which can be created, but not implemented and instantiated known as abstract class. Abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, abstract methods needs to be overrided mandetorily by the derived class.

You cannot create an object to the abstract class. 

Will abstract class contains constructor(s)
